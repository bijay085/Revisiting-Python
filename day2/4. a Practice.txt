Got it! Hereâ€™s a **mixed set** of string practice questions:  for day 2 string operation

1. Take a string input from the user and print its **length**, **first character**, and **last character**.  

2. Given the string `"Game of Thrones"`, print:  
   - The **word "Thrones"** using slicing.  
   - The **reverse of the string** using slicing.  

3. Replace `"apple"` with `"banana"` in this string:  
   ```python
   text = "I love apple pie."
   ```  

4. Find how many times the letter **"o"** appears in `"Hello, how are you?"`.  

5. Check if the string `"Coding is fun!"` **ends with `"fun!"`** and **starts with `"Code"`**.  

6. Convert the sentence `"hElLo PyTHoN"` to **proper sentence case** (`Hello python`).  

7. Take a **full name input** from a user and print:  
   - Only the **first name**.  
   - Only the **last name**.  
   - The full name in **uppercase**.  

8. Extract `"John"` from the string `"Mr. John Wick"` without directly typing `"John"`.  

9. Take a sentence input and find the **index of the first occurrence** of the word `"Python"`.  

10. Given a string `"racecar"`, check if it is a **palindrome** (reads the same forward and backward).  

Try these out and let me know if you need hints! ðŸš€ðŸ”¥
